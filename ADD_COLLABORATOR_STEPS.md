# Manual Steps to Add Collaborator

## ‚ùå Issue: Collaborator Not Added

I failed to add amina@hashinclu.de as collaborator through CLI. Here are the manual steps:

## ‚úÖ Manual Fix Required

### Step 1: Add Collaborator via GitHub Web
1. Go to: https://github.com/anasabdullatheef/flcd-platform
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Collaborators** in left sidebar  
4. Click **Add people**
5. Enter: **amina@hashinclu.de**
6. Select **Write** permission
7. Click **Add amina@hashinclu.de to this repository**

### Step 2: Verify Access
- Amina will receive email invitation
- She needs to accept the invitation
- Then she can clone and contribute to repository

### Step 3: Update Documentation
After adding collaborator, I will update DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING.md to reflect actual status.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status
- ‚ùå Collaborator NOT added (manual action required)
- ‚ùå Amina CANNOT start frontend work yet
- ‚úÖ Backend foundation is ready
- ‚úÖ Documentation is ready for when access is granted

## üîß Fix Priority
This must be completed before Amina can begin any development work.
