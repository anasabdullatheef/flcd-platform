# Development Email Configuration (using Gmail SMTP for testing)
# This is just for demonstration - in production you'd use your own SMTP service

# For Gmail, you need to:
# 1. Enable 2-factor authentication
# 2. Generate an App Password: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833
# 3. Use the App Password here (not your regular Gmail password)

EMAIL_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER="your-gmail@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASS="your-app-password-here"
EMAIL_FROM="FLCD Platform <your-gmail@gmail.com>"

# Leave these empty to use development mode (console logging only)
# EMAIL_HOST=""
