## 🎯 **Manual Setup Instructions**

Since GitHub CLI requires interactive authentication for Projects, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Create Project**
1. Go to https://github.com/anasabdullatheef/flcd-platform
2. Click "Projects" tab
3. Click "Link a project" → "New project"
4. Choose "Board" template
5. Name: "FLCD Platform Development"
6. Description: "10-day sprint development tracking"

### **Step 2: Configure Columns**
Replace default columns with:
1. 📋 Backlog
2. 🔄 Sprint Planning
3. 🚀 In Progress
4. 👀 In Review
5. 🧪 Testing
6. ✅ Done

### **Step 3: Add Custom Fields**
1. Click "+" in field header
2. Add fields:
   - Sprint (Single select): Sprint 1, Sprint 2, Sprint 3
   - Priority (Single select): High, Medium, Low
   - Component (Single select): Backend, Frontend, Mobile, Database
   - Estimate (Number): Story points
   - Developer (Single select): Developer 1, Developer 2

### **Step 4: Add Existing Issues**
1. Click "Add items"
2. Select all 7 existing issues (#1-#7)
3. Configure each issue:
   - Set Sprint based on milestone
   - Set Component based on labels
   - Set Priority (all current issues are High)
   - Assign Developer based on specialization

### **Step 5: Create Views**
1. **Sprint Overview**: Group by Sprint → Status
2. **Developer Workload**: Group by Developer → Status
3. **Component Progress**: Group by Component → Status
4. **Current Sprint**: Filter current sprint only

### **Step 6: Configure Automation**
1. Go to Project Settings → Workflows
2. Enable built-in workflows:
   - "Auto-add to project" for repository issues
   - "Item closed" → Move to Done
   - "Pull request merged" → Move to Done

## 📈 **Project Metrics & Reporting**

### **Daily Metrics**
- Issues completed per day
- Issues in progress per developer
- Blockers and dependencies

### **Sprint Metrics**
- Sprint velocity (story points completed)
- Sprint burndown chart
- Component completion percentage

### **Project Health Indicators**
- Issues overdue
- Pull requests awaiting review
- Test failures blocking progress
